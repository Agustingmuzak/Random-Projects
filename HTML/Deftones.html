        <p>This is Chino Moreno! He may be a little fruity but he's a great singer and he <b><em>used to</em></b> have great hair!</p>

        <p>This is Stephen Carpenter! He's your average retarded stoner, however with only 3 working neurons he managed to make some of the best songs ever! <b>Impressive!</b></p>
            <img src="./Deftones images/Stephen-Carpenter.jpg" alt="He smokes so much! He might develop a lung disease!" height="200" width="200">
    <h3 id="Abe">Abe Cunningham</h3>
        <p>Probably the best metal drummer ever? He beats the shit outta his drums and is pretty lowkey, need I say more?</p>

    <h3 id="Chi">Chi Cheng</h3>
        <p>The coolest member of Deftones by far, but also the worst driver in the band...</p>
            <img src="./Deftones images/Chi-Cheng.jpg" alt="Just look at him, isn't he so cool?" height="200" width="200">
    <h3 id="Frank">Frank Delgado</h3>
        <p>Nobody has a single clue what he does, but we all know he's essential, I guess Chino got him in the band to outweigh the rest racially? Latinx power I guess...</p>
